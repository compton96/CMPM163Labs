    For the first cube on the left, I use my own fragment shader without defining colors to get the rainbow color. 
    For the second cube on the left, I followed the tutorial to get the green specular highlight. 
    For the third cube from the left, I use the my own shader to interpolate between lavender and aquamarine. 
    For the fourth cube from the left, I made its color yellow and its specularity red, but I also made it so shiny that you can't really see the red.
